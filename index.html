                people, and dogs. Her favourite place in the world is the beach.Maisy loves trips in the car and especiallly loves speedbumps.

                feasts on bones, pumpkin, or apple.

                on the couch. Maisy loves playing fetch but doesn't like to drop the
                ball often turning the game into chase. Maisy loves walks and runs and
                after every run hops into her paddling pool in the backyard.
